# Smart City Famework

As many different cities in India are trying to achieve the smart city status, reinventing the wheel again and again, I wish to provide a platform and a framework to the government for implementing various levels automation and over-the-air communication and transfer of official documents. The COVID era has caused great hindrance in day to day dealings in many different government agencies, this has forced us to think of a new way to work and implement things using information technology to our advantage. The aim of this project is to simplify and digitize as many things as possible providing convenience to citizens and avoiding huge physical file storages. 

Simple tasks like applying for a driving license, filing civil court cases, applying for electricity and water connection shall be taken care of easily with just a click of a button. Starting simple and then moving on to mobile payments making them transparent and recorded to avoid corruption, employing grievance portal for complaints and an inter-departmental communication and info sharing. 

Providing citizens with a convenient app to use all these facilities and also enabling the government to share information with the citizens, by the way of notifications. As we have seen the importance of how quick information dissipation can help in disaster management and curbing mass hysteria, it allows governments to achieve their vision as well.
